# Operational Technology (OT) Security: Theory, Techniques, Testing, and Tools

An ongoing & curated collection of awesome software best practices and techniques, libraries and frameworks, E-books and videos, websites, blog posts, links to github Repositories, technical guidelines and important resources about Operational Technology (OT) in Cybersecurity.
> Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! Our goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.

## What is Operational Technology (OT)?

Operational Technology (aka: “OT”) refers to a broad range of programmable systems and devices that directly or indirectly interact with the physical environment. OT plays an active role across all sectors including manufacturing, energy, transportation, medical, and utilities. As OT becomes increasingly interconnected and integrated with IT networks, they become more vulnerable to large-scale cyber attacks. OT also increases the probability of catastrophic outcomes due to their control of the physical environment as opposed to data impacts in an IT environment.

## Significance of Operational Technology (OT)

The significance of safeguarding OT environments cannot be overstated. These systems are integral to the functionality of critical infrastructure, and any disruption or compromise can have severe consequences, ranging from operational downtime and financial losses to potential safety hazards and national security risks. Despite their importance, OT systems often lack the robust cybersecurity measures commonly found in IT environments, primarily due to the legacy nature of many industrial control systems (ICS) and the historical focus on availability and reliability over security.
